## What is Cohesiq

Cohesiq is a B2B SaaS marketplace that connects brands with the right content creators using an explainable AI matching engine. Brands describe a campaign — by typing, talking, or uploading a brief — and Cohesiq ranks creators by niche, budget, platform, engagement, language, and recency, then drives the relationship through an offer, negotiation, and contract lifecycle. It is built for the Bangladesh influencer market and seeded with real, verified creator data.

## The problem

Bangladesh's influencer marketing is fragmented and largely manual. Brands discover creators through word of mouth and spreadsheets, have no reliable way to gauge fit or fair pricing, and negotiate over scattered DMs with no contract trail. Creators, in turn, lack a single place to surface their reach and rates to serious buyers. Cohesiq replaces that guesswork with data-driven, explainable matching and a structured deal pipeline.

## Key features

- **Explainable AI matching engine** — a 6-factor weighted score (niche 0.45, budget 0.20, platform 0.15, engagement 0.10, language 0.08, recency 0.02) with a per-factor breakdown so brands understand *why* a creator ranks where they do.
- **Voice + PDF campaign creation** — describe a campaign out loud (transcribed via Groq Whisper) or upload a brief PDF; an LLM extracts structured campaign fields automatically.
- **Offer & negotiation flow** — brands send offers, creators counter, and both sides negotiate within the platform until terms are accepted.
- **Contract lifecycle** — accepted offers convert into trackable contracts with engagement types, clauses, and a defined state machine.
- **Creator discovery** — filterable, URL-driven marketplace of verified creators with profiles, rate cards, and portfolios.
- **Admin panel** — role-gated `/admin` area (Clerk-metadata auth) for read-only oversight of users, campaigns, and platform activity.
- **YouTube enrichment** — pulls live channel metrics from the YouTube Data API to keep creator profiles current.

## Architecture

Cohesiq is a decoupled full-stack application: a **Next.js 16** App Router frontend talks to a **FastAPI** backend over HTTP, and the backend persists everything to **PostgreSQL 16** (relational-only). The backend follows Domain-Driven Design (`auth`, `brands`, `creators`, `campaigns`, plus cross-domain `services`), where routers only parse requests and all logic lives in the service layer. Authentication is handled by Clerk using RS256 JWTs validated against Clerk's JWKS on the backend. The entire stack is orchestrated with Docker Compose (`postgres`, `backend`, `frontend`, `ngrok`).

See **[`docs/diagrams/architecture.md`](docs/diagrams/architecture.md)** for the full as-built diagram (containers, ports, external services, request paths, and env vars).

## Tech stack

| Layer | Technologies |
|---|---|
| **Frontend** | Next.js 16 (App Router), React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4, shadcn/ui, Clerk auth |
| **Backend** | FastAPI, Python 3.12, SQLAlchemy 2.0 (async), Alembic, Pydantic v2 |
| **Data** | PostgreSQL 16 (relational-only); 67 verified Bangladesh YouTube channels seeded |
| **AI** | Groq `llama-3.1-8b-instant` (extraction/matching), Groq Whisper `large-v3-turbo` (voice), Gemini `1.5-flash` + `text-embedding-004` (semantic) |
| **Infra** | Docker Compose (`postgres`, `backend`, `frontend`, `ngrok`), Clerk, YouTube Data API |

## Quick start

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) and Docker Compose
- A [Clerk](https://clerk.com/) account (publishable + secret keys)
- API keys: [Groq](https://console.groq.com/) and [Google Gemini](https://aistudio.google.com/); a [YouTube Data API](https://console.cloud.google.com/) key for enrichment

### 1. Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sakibhossain323/cohesiq.git
cd cohesiq
```

### 2. Configure environment variables

Copy the example files and fill in your keys. Never commit `.env` files.

```bash
# Backend — set CLERK_SECRET_KEY, DATABASE_URL, GROQ_API_KEY, GEMINI_API_KEY, YouTube key
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env

# Frontend — set NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY and CLERK_SECRET_KEY
cp frontend/cohesiq-v0/.env.example frontend/cohesiq-v0/.env
```

> The frontend uses a two-variable API contract: `BACKEND_API_URL` (`http://backend:8000`, server-side only) and `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` (`http://localhost:8000`, browser only). Do not mix them up.

### 3. Run the stack

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

- Frontend → http://localhost:3000
- Backend → http://localhost:8000
- Interactive API docs (Swagger) → http://localhost:8000/docs

### 4. Seed the database

Load the canonical seed (real Bangladesh creator data) once the containers are up:

```bash
docker compose exec -T postgres psql -U cohesiq -d cohesiq < db/seed.sql
```

`db/seed.sql` is a symlink to the latest snapshot in `db/snapshots/`. To wipe and re-seed, see [`docs/seeding.md`](docs/seeding.md).

## Contributing

1. **Branch from `main`** — create a feature branch; never commit directly to `main`. Open a PR for review.
2. **Graphify-first** — this repo ships a live AST knowledge graph at `graphify-out/`. Before grepping source, run `graphify query "<question>"`, `graphify explain "<concept>"`, or `graphify path "<A>" "<B>"` to locate relevant code. Run `graphify update .` after meaningful changes.
3. **Track your work** — confirm the task exists in the relevant `docs/tasks/tasks-*.md` backlog before implementing, and mark it done/partial/broken afterward.
4. **Respect the layering** — backend routers parse requests only; all logic lives in the service layer with no cross-domain imports. Frontend follows the Server Component → Client Island pattern and always uses `fetchApi()` from `lib/api/client.ts`.
5. **Use design tokens** — never hardcode colors, font sizes, spacing, or shadows. See [`docs/design-system.md`](docs/design-system.md).
